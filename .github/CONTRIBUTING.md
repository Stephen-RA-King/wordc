# Implementing changes

If you want to enhance wordc by implementing a changes, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/Stephen-RA-King/wordc/issues/new) first.

Then, implement the following workflow:

1.  Fork the [wordc](https://github.com/Stephen-RA-King/wordc) project from GitHub.

2.  Create a virtual environment with your favourite tool (virtualenv with virtualenv wrapper, venv etc)
    using one of the supported versions of Python: ![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/wordc).

3.  Activate your virtual environment.

4.  Clone the repository locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:Stephen-RA-King/wordc.git
        $ cd wordc

5.  Install wordc in development mode:

        $ pip install -e .

6.  Install pre-commit hooks that will check your commits:

        $ pre-commit install --install-hooks

7.  Create a new branch from `main`:

        $ git checkout main
        $ git branch fix_bug
        $ git checkout fix_bug

8.  Implement the modifications. During the process of development, honor [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as possible.

9.  Add unit tests and ensure all are passing:

        $ tox

10. Update the documentation.

11. If your development modifies wordc behavior, update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with your changes.

12. `add` and `commit` your changes, then `push` your local project:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m 'Add succinct explanation of what changed'
        $ git push origin fix_bug

13. If previous step failed due to the pre-commit hooks, fix reported errors and try again.

14. Finally, [open a pull request](Stephen-RA-King/wordc/compare) before getting it merged!
